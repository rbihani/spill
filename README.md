# Spill 🎭  
AI-powered Truth or Dare — when the group runs out of ideas, Spill takes over.

## 🧠 What It Is  
Spill is a playful, mobile-first web app that uses AI to generate Truth or Dare prompts on demand. Built in Figma and coded in Cursor, it’s designed to feel sleek, minimal, and chaotic (in a good way). Just pick your mode and let the AI do the talking.

## ✨ Features  
- **AI-Generated Prompts** – Truth or Dare questions, freshly made every time  
- **Glassmorphic UI** – Dark mode, subtle gradients, and blurred card design  
- **Mobile-First** – Designed specifically for that *“we’re on the couch playing games”* moment  
- **No Signups, No Setup** – Just open and tap  
- **Built in Cursor** – From Figma to code in days  

## 📱 How to Use  
1. Choose **Truth 😳** or **Dare 😈**  
2. Hit the **“hit me with it”** button  
3. Read, cringe, or confess  
4. Tap **“another one”** to keep going
